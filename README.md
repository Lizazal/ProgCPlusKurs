Coursework #2 (language: C++)
Task: Create a database that works on the basis of a container, which also should be developed. As a container prototype, the vector container from the STL library is used. The database being developed must be created using C++ and the Qt library. Objects of a class that characterizes a bank client should be used as container elements.
